This privacy policy explains how I collect, use and protect your personal information when you visit this website.

## Website Hosting

This website is built using Hugo and hosted on Github Pages. This is a simple static website that doesn't require any database or backend systems. Github may collect some information in the background for security and service maintenance purposes. You can read more in their [Github Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Analytics

This website uses AnalyticsZ, a privacy-focused web analytics service, to understand how visitors use the site and improve your experience. AnalyticsZ is designed to be compliant with GDPR, PECR, and other privacy regulations.

### What data is collected

AnalyticsZ collects limited, anonymous usage data including:
- Pages you visit on this website (page URLs)
- How you arrived at the site (referring website)
- Your country (derived from anonymised IP address - your full IP is never stored)
- Browser type and version
- Device type

All data is aggregated and anonymised, ensuring it cannot be traced back to you as an individual user.

### How your privacy is protected

- **No cookies:** AnalyticsZ does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- **No personal data:** No personally identifiable information is collected
- **IP anonymisation:** Your IP address is anonymised immediately and never stored in full
- **Aggregated data only:** All analytics data is aggregated and cannot identify individual users
- **GDPR compliant:** AnalyticsZ is designed to be fully GDPR-compliant

### Legal basis

We process this analytics data based on our legitimate interest in understanding how our website is used and improving the user experience, as permitted under Article 6(1)(f) of UK GDPR.

### Your rights

While UK GDPR provides rights such as data access, deletion, and objection to processing, these are not applicable here as AnalyticsZ does not collect personally identifiable information. If you have any concerns about privacy, you can contact me through the [contact page](/contact).
