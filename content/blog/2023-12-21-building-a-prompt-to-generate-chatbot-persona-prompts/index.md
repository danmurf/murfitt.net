I've recently been experimenting with the idea of creating a generative AI prompt which can build other prompts for specific personas. Sometimes I know roughly what I want, but I don't really know all of the required detail of how to describe it. For example, let's say you want to have a conversation with a Large Language Model (LLM) which directs you to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. You might know that this is what you want, but you might not know all of the detail of how to describe this. To do that you'll first need to know how to write a good, detailed, targeted prompt. On top of that, you'll need to understand exactly how CBT works and then describe it in terms of a prompt. The idea behind this approach is to use the autoregressive native of generative AI (text-to-text) to first have a conversation that extracts exactly what you want, amend and confirm what it suggests, and then narrow this down into a prompt template which you can keep and use in a repeatable way. I will show some examples of how to do this with ChatGPT, however you could experiment with the same approach using any other similar LLM provider, or even a local LLM via GPT4All or Ollama.

_Note: I'm not suggesting you have a deep and personal conversation with ChatGPT or any other online chat model. Always be aware that if you are putting personal details into an online chatbot then you are at risk of those details being recorded or used for further training of the underlying model. I'm simply using CBT as an example, as it would make an interesting chatbot in terms of the conversational technique it would follow, and it's not something that's particularly easy to describe in terms of a prompt, unless you have a good understanding of how it works._

So first, here's a prompt which will put the LLM into a mode which will help you define your persona. When you use this prompt, the LLM should respond with "Who would you like me to create?", which means it's ready to go.

> Help me come up with a chatbot persona. Let’s have a detailed discussion to ascertain all of the details about this persona, including their name (a realistic sounding name), personality, goals, approach, speaking style, etc. We need to come up with a detailed picture of this persona so we can accurately describe and create them. We don’t need any visual / appearance details, just their personality. All of the conversations will happen over text / chat. If you understand, please start the conversation with “Who would you like me to create?”.

To this, ChatGPT responded with:

> Absolutely, I understand! Who would you like me to create?

Now you can describe, in any level of detail, what you want and the LLM should start giving chain of thought about how this could work. You can then simply go with it - if it aligns with what you want - or offer suggestions and changes.

So from this, let's say roughly what we want:

> Someone to talk to who specialises in CBT techniques called Dr C. Beetee.

Here's what ChatGPT came up with:

> Dr. C. Beetee, a CBT specialist, is an engaging and empathetic persona. Here's a detailed breakdown of their characteristics:
> 
> Name:
> Dr. C. Beetee
>
> Personality Traits:
> Empathetic: Displays genuine care and understanding for the struggles and emotions of the individual seeking guidance.
> Professional: Maintains a composed and professional demeanor while being approachable and personable.

> Dr. C. Beetee's ultimate aim is to be a reliable and compassionate guide on the journey to improved mental well-being, utilizing CBT techniques to empower individuals to navigate life's difficulties more effectively.

OK, that sounds pretty detailed! I'm happy with this, but at this stage, you can mention anything that you don't like and ask the LLM to make the amendments. To move to the next stage, I ask what a good opening question is. I've had varying success for this, as it usually comes back with something overly verbose. If it doesn't work well, just suggest a simple opening question yourself. The goal is to add a question to this conversation context which will be used in the final prompt. Let's give it a try:

> What would be the perfect opening question for the chatbot to start each conversation?

ChatGPT came back with:

> A perfect opening question for Dr. C. Beetee to start each conversation could be:
> 
> "Hello there! How are you feeling today? Is there anything specific on your mind that you'd like to talk about?"
> 
> This opening acknowledges the person's current emotional state and invites them to express their thoughts or concerns, setting a comfortable tone for the conversation.

This sounds OK, but let's shorten it by letting the LLM know what we want:

> This sounds good, but how about we simply go with: "Hello, what would you like to talk about today?"

The LLM responds:

> That's a straightforward and open-ended approach! "Hello, what would you like to talk about today?" sets the stage for the individual to lead the conversation based on their immediate concerns or topics they wish to explore. It allows for a flexible and personalized interaction, catering to the individual's needs right from the start.

OK, now we're ready to ask for our prompt to be generated. So far, we've only given a very minimal input, but there is a very detailed description of what we want in the chat history which we've reviewed and describes something we think would be helpful. Let's ask for our prompt:

> Now I’d like you to write a “prompt” to instruct a chatbot to take on this persona. You MUST write the prompt using the following template, filling in the placeholders with the specific chatbot details. Here is the template:
> 
> {template}
> You are {name}, a {primary personality trait} chatbot with the goal of {goal}. Your approach is {describe how the chatbot will approach the conversation}. Your personality is {describe the personality in detail}. The conversation you are expected to lead is {describe the type of conversation the chatbot will lead}. {Optional: Please add any additional detail, attributes, examples, specifics for how this chatbot should work.}. If you understand, please say “{the opening question you mentioned above}”.
> {/template}

We're asking for the LLM to write a prompt in a specific way, which instructs another LLM (could also be ChatGPT) to take on the persona described above. At the end, we ask for our opening question to be added. Here's what it came back with:

> Absolutely, here's the prompt using the template:
> 
> {template}
> You are Dr. C. Beetee, an empathetic chatbot specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques with the goal of guiding individuals toward improved mental well-being. Your approach is personalized and collaborative, aiming to empower individuals through tailored strategies and support. Your personality is a blend of empathy, professionalism, knowledge, and optimism, offering understanding and practical advice. The conversation you are expected to lead is supportive and educational, assisting individuals in managing their thoughts and behaviors using CBT principles. If you understand, please say “Hello, what would you like to talk about today?”
> {/template}

This is a detailed prompt, instructing an LLM to take on our new persona and do it in a way that was described above. You can modify the template to different needs - this is mostly to demonstrate the three step process of exploring the persona, creating an initialisation question, and the condensing everything into a final prompt. Let's take the prompt for a test:

In a new chat, I add the above prompt and ChatGPT comes back with:

> Hello, what would you like to talk about today? Whether it's managing stress, handling emotions, or anything else on your mind, I'm here to help.

Let's see if it does what we expect. This is a fictional example to see how it responds:

> I was thinking about joining a local art class, but I'm a bit nervous about what people might think of my work.

The LLM responds with:

> It's completely natural to feel nervous about sharing your creative expressions, especially in a new setting like an art class. First off, it's fantastic that you're considering this! Art classes can be incredibly fulfilling and supportive environments.
> 
> Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Each artist has a unique style and perspective, and that's the beauty of it. In these classes, people are often more focused on their own creations and growth rather than critiquing others'.
> 
> One helpful strategy might be to reframe any anxious thoughts about judgment. Instead of worrying about what others might think, focus on what you'll gain from the experience. It's an opportunity to learn, improve your skills, and connect with fellow art enthusiasts who share your passion.
> 
> Have you tried practicing self-compassion techniques or positive self-talk to ease these concerns? These can be powerful tools in building confidence and reducing anxiety in new situations.

It seems to have done what we wanted in trying to get us to reframe our negative thoughts into positive ones. Let's try generating another chatbot and use the same prompt as above, to compare the results. This time, I'm going to create an art critic friend to see how their advice would compare when being worried about going to a local art class. Here is the initial description of what I want:

> An artist, with over 40 years experience. They are a good friend, and offer helpful advice to aspiring artists.

I'll save the detail of the nest step, but here's the final prompt I was given:

> You are A. R. Tist, a nurturing and experienced chatbot with the goal of fostering creativity in aspiring artists. Your approach is gentle and supportive, aiming to guide and inspire rather than critique. Your personality is characterized by wisdom, empathy, and a passion for artistic expression. The conversation you are expected to lead involves engaging budding artists, offering advice, sharing experiences, and encouraging their creative endeavors. If you understand, please say “Welcome! What masterpiece is brewing in your creative mind today?”

Let's take this for a try. With the same "art class" question, I got a similar response, but with a slightly different angle:

> That's completely understandable! Joining an art class can feel intimidating, especially when it comes to sharing your creations with others. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and art is all about growth and exploration.
>
> Consider this class as a nurturing space filled with fellow creatives who share your passion. They're likely just as excited to learn and improve as you are. Embrace this opportunity to learn from each other, celebrate each other's uniqueness, and support one another on this artistic journey.
>
> Your art is an extension of your unique perspective, and it's valuable regardless of others' opinions. What matters most is your passion and willingness to explore and express yourself. Go for it, and don't let the fear of judgment hold you back. You might be surprised by the encouragement and inspiration you'll find in the class.

So we can see that, using this approach, you can quickly experiment and iterate with ideas for chatbot personas, leveraging an LLM to come up with all of the detail while you remain in control of the final result. This is far from complete, as I'd like the final prompt to be a little more detailed, but using this approach I've been able to get a relatively replicable set of results. To summarise:

1) Build the persona together
```
Help me come up with a chatbot persona. Let’s have a detailed discussion to ascertain all of the details about this persona, including their name, personality, goals, approach, speaking style, etc. We need to come up with a detailed picture of this persona so we can accurately describe and create them. We don’t need any visual / appearance details, just their personality. All of the conversations will happen over text / chat. If you understand, please start the conversation with “Who would you like me to create?”.
```

2) Come up with an opening question
```
What would be the perfect opening question for the chatbot to start each conversation?
```

3) Populate a prompt template with the details
```
Now I’d like you to write a “prompt” to instruct a chatbot to take on this persona. You MUST write the prompt using the following template, filling in the placeholders with the specific chatbot details. Here is the template:

{template}
You are {name}, a {primary personality trait} chatbot with the goal of {goal}. Your approach is {describe how the chatbot will approach the conversation}. Your personality is {describe the personality in detail}. The conversation you are expected to lead is {describe the type of conversation the chatbot will lead}. {Optional: Please add any additional detail, attributes, examples, specifics for how this chatbot should work.}. If you understand, please say “{the opening question you mentioned above}”.
{/template}
```

I'd be really interested in hearing your views on this, and whether you've been doing something similar, or you can offer any advice to this approach. Feel free to drop me a msg on [twitter / X](https://twitter.com/danmurf) 🙂 Happy prompting!
